## Why?
I was not happy with the current solutions for keeping track of expenses. Pen and paper, or even spreadsheets were to time consuming.
Online solutions like Mint or Goodbudget offered to many options which made it impossible to just use the basic functionality.
I needed a way to quickly track my expenses, and at a glance see how much money I have left to spend in any given week or month. That's why I created this budget app.

## Features:
This budget app allows you to quickly track your expeses.
- Features like the datepicker, autofill, and smart date defaults make it extremely quick to track all your expenses on a weekly and monthly basis.
- The summary charts allow you to quickly see how much money is left in each catogory of your budget every week and month.
- It's very fast to switch between weeks and months to review expenses and see where your spending is at.

## Why Meteor?
Meteor's template feature makes it very easy to modulize every item on the web page for easy reorganization during design iterations.
The Meteor method of "combined" front and back end allowed for a extremely fast development time.
I believe that Meteor is one of the best tools for small projects like this.
